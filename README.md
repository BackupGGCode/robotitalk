#Robotitalk
RobotiTalk (pronounced roBOT-ee-talk) is a Windows GUI application for communicating with serial based micro-controllers such as those made by Arduino, Parallax, etc.

In addition, it provides a GUI platform for developing your own specialized micro-controller .net classes and either using the built in GUI to communicate with them, or your own custom GUI, hosted in RobotiTalk.
